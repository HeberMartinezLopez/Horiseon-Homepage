This repo contains HTML code and CSS styling code used to complete challenge 01 of UCB Coding Bootcamp. In this challenge assignment, we were given starting code from the class program to clean up. Many changes were necessary in order to assure that the application's links all function correctly, all the CSS selectors and properties are consolidated and organized, and properly commented.
